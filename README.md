Projekt Bionische Methoden der Optimierung: Party Planing Problem solved by Bee-Algorithm

Implementation of the Bee-Algorithm
1. Use structure of BeeTest.m
2. Optimization Problem
  - max. amount of cocktails (liter) for a given amount of recepies (n)
  - min. amount of ingredients to buy
3. Boundary conditions
  - amount of recepies:                     n
  - ingredients stock has to be empty       -
  - recepies in a bee have to be(e) unique  -
4. Neighbourhood
  - switch (one) random recepie of bee with another random recepie from database
